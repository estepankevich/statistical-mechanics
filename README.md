Having fun applying sampling and monte carlo methods in physics from coursera [online-course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/statistical-mechanics):
- Quantum Statistical Mechanics
- Phase transitions
- Simulated Annealing
- LÃ©vy Paths Integrals
- Bose-Einstein condensation
- Ising model
- Advanced Monte Carlo

It is a really great course and I recommend it to everybody!
