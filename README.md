Having fun applying sampling and monte carlo methods in physics from coursera [online-course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/statistical-mechanics):
- Statistical Mechanics
- Phase transitions
- Simulated Annealing
- Quantum Statistical mechanics
- LÃ©vy Paths Integrals
- Bose-Einstein condensation
- Ising model
- Advanced Monte Carlo
